# Cobblemon Tracker

## Python Script for Tracking Cobblemon in Minecraft

This script uses the `minescript` library to track loaded Cobblemon every 'x' seconds. You can specify which Cobblemon to track in-game.

### Features

2. **Written Guide**: Call the tracker in Minecraft chat with the command:
   
   ```
   \pokemon (cobblemon)
   ```
   
   Example:
   
   ```
   \pokemon eevee
   ```

3. **Functionality**: Once a request is made, you will receive a private pop-up in chat every 'x' seconds. This will return the coordinates of the specified Cobblemon (only visible to you).
